## Testing Requirements

- Framework: `pytest`
- Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
- Coverage: test edge cases and errors
- New features require tests
- Bug fixes require regression tests

- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
