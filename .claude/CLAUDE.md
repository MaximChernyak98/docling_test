# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use pip

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 120 chars maximum

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `pytest`
   - Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests

4. Code Style
    - PEP 8 naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
    - Class names in PascalCase
    - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - Use f-strings for formatting

- For commits fixing bugs or adding features based on user reports add:
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Reported-by:<name>"
  ```
  Where `<name>` is the name of the user.

- For commits related to a Github issue, add
  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#<number>"
  ```
- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
- **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
- **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

## Coding Best Practices

- **Early Returns**: Use to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear variable/function names (prefix handlers with "handle")
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants where possible
- **DRY Code**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable approaches when not verbose
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand
- **Function Ordering**: Define composing functions before their components
- **TODO Comments**: Mark issues in existing code with "TODO:" prefix
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- **Build Iteratively** Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- **Functional Code**: Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- **Clean logic**: Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- **File Organsiation**: Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale

## Pull Requests

- Create a detailed message of what changed. Focus on the high level description of
  the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the
  code unless it adds clarity.

- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Best Practices
- Check git status before commits
- Keep changes minimal
- Follow existing patterns
- Document public APIs
- Test thoroughly
- I should always generate small amount of code. Before the generation estimate the size of the task and warn if it is better to split it into parts. You should try to plan the task that you can do inside the context window.
- Always use correct information. If there is no information do not imagine anything and just answer that you don't know and ask more questions.
- Use the simplest format for .sh files without any colors - only login and comments it the compicated parts
- use docstings only in the very complex functions. Use comments only in the non-obvious parts. Do not use comments without neccesity
